# JavaScript

## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a High Level Programming Language. It is an interpreted scripting language, and is multi-paradigm (Functional, OOP, Event-Driven, Procedural).

Primarily used to perform client-side rendering of websites (adds dynamic features to websites). Can be used for server-side applications with Node.js.

## Intepreted

The code is executed as it is read. It is run without being rewritten as machine code. It is not compiled like many classical programming languages, such as Java or C++.

## Compiled

When you transform high-level code into lower-level code, which is closer to machine language. Most traditionally, languages are compiled directly to a native machine code. This is not always the case, such as with Java.

## High-Level Code

Close to a language that can be understood by humans. We do not need to be aware of the machine architecture upon which our code is running (sort of, refer to C).

Examples
- C
- C++
- C#
- Java
- JavaScript
- Python
- PHP
- Rust
- Go
- Ruby
- etc

## Low-Level Code

Closer to binary. Harder for humans to understand. Fine control over the machine. It is very efficient.

- Assembly

## Scripting Language

A language that is intended to automate tasks.

## Coding Paradigm

A way to think about solving a problem.

### Object-Oriented Programming Paradigm

When I have a problem, I model that problem as an object or objects. Then I use those object's state and behaviors to solve the problem.

### Functional Paradigm

When I have a problem, I create functions that, when called, will solve the problem.
(Has more advanced nuances, such as immutable data and such)

### Event-Driven Paradigm

When I have a problem, I create an event that, when triggered, will solve the problem.

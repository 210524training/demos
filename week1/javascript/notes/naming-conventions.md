# Naming Conventions
- camelCase
- PascalCase
- snake_case
- shishkebab-case
- UPPER_CASE
- lowercase
- name.domain.reverse
    - Think about common domain names like "docs.google.com"
    - That would be written as com.google.docs
    - Used primarily with package naming in Java

## JavaScript Conventions
- Variable Names are `camelCase`
- Function Names are `camelCase`
- Class Names are `PascalCase`
- File Names are either:
    - `lowercase`
    - `shiskebab-case`
- Constructor Functions (similarly to classes) are `PascalCase`

### Sometimes used in JavaScript

Single or double underscores to denote unused variables or parameters

`_value` or `__field`
This is used primarily because JavaScript does not have any sort of `private` access

## Others

Some other languages use `UPPER_CASE` to denote constant values (like Pi)

## Disclaimer

The correct naming conventions are the ones used by your company.

# Project 2

Due Date: July 23rd

## Technologies

- React Native
- AWS Lambda & AWS API Gateway
- DynamoDB/PostgreSQL

## Tools
- Trello Board
  - Keep track of when each user story ws completed so you can make a Burndown Chart
  - Add me to this
- GitHub Repository
  - You can have multiple
  - Separate frontend/backend repos
  - Will be created in the Batch Organization
  - Must make it public

## Requirements
You will need to create a Project Write-up. 2 - 3 paragraphs explaining what the project does, what roles the project includes, and what each those roles can do. You should also explain what each layer of the application is in charge of.

- Frontend needs to have responsibilities (like route guarding and validation or data manipulation)
- Backend needs to have responsibilities (like authentication, validation, data manipulation/calculations)
- Databases must have *meaningful* data storage
  - We aren't just building a game and saving the game state
  - We are creating data that needs to be saved and can be manipulated according to some useful application

1. There need to be at least 2 distinct roles in the application (user/employee/admin)
2. Those roles must have distinct functionality in your application
3. You must come up with at least 15 user stories
4. There must be a Burndown Chart as part of your presentation
5. There will be a *real* presentation
  - Powerpoint
  - Fully practiced
  - Demo
  - etc
6. You must elect a Team Leader

## Very common but not always needed
Incorporate Third Party APIs (Generally RESTful APIs).
The below Fridge application used a public API to obtain the recipes.
If you do this, this may not be the ONLY functionality of the application.
It can be a very central aspect, but it should not exclusively delegate to the API.

The application cannot be too small, and effectively barebones, but you must also be careful
not to plan for more than your group can handle.
We will be learning the required technologies as we work on the project.

Plan to have some stretch goals.
We have a term called MVP or "Minimum Viable Product". Your application should be an MVP.
Should still satisfy the project idea you outlined at the beginning.

### Examples of past projects
- Games with messaging built in
- Dating apps
- Gacha games
- Fridge application
  - Tell the app what ingredients you have, and it provides recipes
- IMS (Inventory Management Systems) (like a vending machine)
- Process Management Systems (TRMS)

## Agile Scrum

We will be following a Scrum methodology.
We will have daily standups for the rest of the batch.
I will also ask your team leader if there are any issues after each standup along with current project progress.
